# Gesture Audio Control
Gesture Audio Control is an OpenCV Python &amp; Computer Vision Project

### Description
* The project demonstrates the control of Audio of any device using Hand Gesture as per the user's action.
* It uses **OpenCV, MediaPipe** built by Google to detect Hand Gesture on the camera, and **"pycaw" Python Package** that allows the program to modify the audio drivers of the system.
* On running, the program first launches the camera and tries to detect the Hand.
* On detection of hand, the program tries to identify the gesture as per the user's action and accordingly changes the system's volume.
